# Best practices rules for performance - Code examples

In this repository you will find code examples for best practices on performance, which you can find in our open catalog: https://www.codee.com/knowledge/ 

In this catalog you can see different types of actions:

- **Recommendations** on how to rewrite the code to enable higher performance.
- **Opportunities** to clearly take advantage of different ways of improving performance from sequential code optimizations up to different types parallel execution from vectorization, multithreading to offloading.
- **Defects** present in your source code.
- **Remarks** to suggest how to use the tools properly.

And all of this, complemented with a glossary of the key terms and concepts that the team needs to understand and apply to understand why the code is running slower and how to fix these performance issues.

All recommendations, opportunities, defects and remarks are automatically detected and reported by Codee, and in some cases, it can rewrite the code automatically following the guidelines.
